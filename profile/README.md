SuperTokens is an open source authentication solution offering features like:
- Different types of login: Email / password, Passwordless (OTP or Magic link based), Social / OAuth 2.0 etc...
- Access control
- Session management
- User management
- Self hosted / managed cloud

## Architecture
![Architecture Diagram](https://supertokens.com/img/architecture/self_hosted_generic.png)

Our architecture is different than other auth providers as your backend API layer sits in the middle of your frontend and SuperTokens. This enables easy customizations to our auth logic and also enables us to provide a [secure session solution](https://supertokens.com/blog/the-best-way-to-securely-manage-user-sessions).
### Backend SDKs Available:
- [NodeJS](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-node)
- [Python](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-python)
- [GoLang](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-golang)

### Frontend SDKs Available:
- [Vanilla JS (Vue / Angular / JS)](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-web-js)
- [ReactJS](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react)
- [React-Native](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-react-native)

## Getting started
Visit out [guides page](https://supertokens.com/docs/guides) to pick the login type you want and then follow the quick setup. You can also follow framework specific integration guides for NextJS, NestJS, RedwoodJS or GraphQL.

We have a variety of [example apps](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/tree/master/examples) available in our repos. You can usually find them in the examples folder in a repo.
